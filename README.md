# CREOSON

CREOSON is an OpenSource initiative by Simplified Logic, Inc. to promote automation of PTC's CREO Parametric.

CREOSON uses simple JSON Requests to send commands/functions to CREO, JSON Responses are used to communicate the results of your requests.



# Get the Pre-Packaged Distribution!
If you are not a "developer"... the Pre-Packaged Distribution is available as either a 32-bit or 64-bit distribution and has the correct version of Java already baked-in!  So it is literally a download, unzip and run CREOSON Micro-Server!

 Pre-Packaged Distributions are located here:
 - --> [Download CRESOSON Releases](https://github.com/SimplifiedLogic/creoson/releases) <--



### Minimum Requirements

CREOSON Requires the following to work:

* CREO Parametric - Version 2.0 or Later... 3.0/4.0 have most coverage/stability.
* JLINK - This is a FREE Interface with CREO Parametric, but must be installed!
* Permissions on your machine - don't forget to check your firewall!

* A "little" programming/scripting knowledge does not hurt.



### Installation?

There is nothing to "install", the Pre-Packaged Distribution contains everything you need, but here are some basic steps to follow:

1. Download your Pre-Packaged Distribution
2. Move the ZIP file to a directory where you want CREOSON to run from
3. UNZIP the Pre-Packaged Distribution
4. Run the CreosonSetup.exe
5. Select your CREO Installation Directory
6. Select a PORT Number for the CREOSON Server to use
7. Press "Start CREOSON"
- Creoson is now running!
8. Press "Open Documentation"
- We suggest you check out the "Playground" to play with a few commands, then jump over to the "Functions" section and dig into the examples.

### Why JSON?!

JSON was chosen becasue it is super generic and easy to work with.

Typically, CREO Parametric automation options are limited to a specific set of core languages like C/C++/C#, Java and Visual Basic.  JSON enables you to use ANY programming/scripting language to manipulate CREO Parametric via CREOSON.  So you can use scripting languages like Ruby, Python, PHP or even Web Technologies like AJAX to perform operations in CREO quite easily - and faster!


### The Geeky CREOSON Details

CREOSON uses a Micro-Server to "listen" for JSON requests and then handles/translates them into JLINK calls via our long-used "jShell" interface to JLINK.  jShell is a highly optimized business/logic-interface to JLINK and CREOSON is the JSON interface to jShell.  If it is confusing... well.. you are reading the "geeky" section... DON'T worry - most users will only need to use Pre-Packaged Distribution and learn how to use JSON Transactions to do amazing things quickly.
